    <hr />
    <p align="center" style="font-size:25px;">
      Just as in music, food, clothing, and many other things, peoples tastes' vary diversely when it comes to comedy. So what you choose to write about depends solely on <b>YOU</b>.
      You want to write what is funny to <b>YOU</b> because it is difficult to sell a joke you dont believe to be funny.
      And the reality of it is, not everyone is going to think you are funny, that's just the nature of this profession, just like not everyone likes rap music, not everyone likes
      rock music, etc. You <b>WILL NOT</b> please everyone all the time, accept that. </p>
      <br>

    <p align="center" style="font-size:25px;">
      The other thing you have to decide is whether you want work "clean" or if you are going to use profanity in your jokes.
      More doors, opportunity-wise, are open for the clean comedian. They can work anyplace that allows profanity, and all the places that don't.
      This isn't always discovered right away. Some comedians work for many years before finding out who they really are on stage.</p>
      <br>

    <p align="center" style="font-size:25px;">
      So now comes the actual physical act of writing your joke. One key to comedy is misdirection.
      Lead your audience down one path and switch it up right at the end. This can be a difficult process to master but practice makes perfect.
      For example, if I say <b>"You what I absolutely cannot stand?"</b> Then answer with <b>"My kids"</b>, it gets a reaction out of people because they think
      you are going to name something else like mosquitos or bad drivers or something, and then you say something that most everyone can relate to
      but wouldn't normally say in public, and it really is that simple.
      <br>

    <p align="center" style="font-size:25px;">
      Again, only through practice will you learn what works and what doesn't.
      A joke can look and sound good on paper but when you actually tell it on stage, it might be too long, or not have enough information for
      the audience to comprehend it. You have to consider setting up the joke, timing, and delivery. It sounds confusing but once you get it, you got it.
      The beauty about writing comedy is that it can essentially be about <b>anything</b>.
      I choose to take my every day experiences as a husband, father, and living in a small town and just convey that to my audience.
      Presented below is my version of standup in addition to clips about comedy coming from some of the best to ever do it. <b>Enjoy!!</b>

      I give this place alot of credit. They gave me a lot of stage time and I was
      able to work on my material, i.e. delivery, timing, etc. I've opened for many comedians
      and competed in a handful of comedy competitions and I've did it all from this venue, thank you Red Door!!!</p>
