# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.
## Donovan Archambault
I took this class as an opportunity to learn the ropes of web design in the then event that one day I might create my own web page. I have always been intimidated by "writing code" because it looks like something only people with the last name Zuckerberg would understand. The readings made it somewhat more comprehendible but I still have my work cut out for me. I am a fast learner and always up for a good challenge.

- I've learned that the internet and the web are two different things, never knew that.
- I've learned that there are actual under-sea cables that connect the world. Country by country, continent by continent, we are all connected through a series of wires and cables. Take highways for example, if you live on or near a paved street or road, you can go outside right now and stand on it and you would be connected via pavement or blacktop to virtually anywhere in the United States. Crazy.
- The emoji tracker was unbelievable. Its nice to know I'm not the only one using those stupid things.
